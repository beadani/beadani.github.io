<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hi! My name is Daniel. I have interests in IT and English. I love playing video games, especially ones like RPGs and MMOs. I love to play the piano, and have a cat called Ziggy. He's a tortoise shell tabby, and pretty feral(haha)... I have a youtube account that I upload to every once in a while, and in most of my free time i'm either playing sports or playing video games! My favourite food by far is Pizza. I've been at St Aloysius College for 3 years now, and I'm about to go into the Senior School. So far I'm pretty nervous, but I think i'll do well there.</p>
